About
=====

Phostery is a local album manager, where you can put some photos but nothing goes on servers. All images are only in the browser, nothing goes outside, always available when you come back! You can find options, but everything is only for your eyes. But if you want, you can share them for someone, and they can make tweaks and changes to it too !
